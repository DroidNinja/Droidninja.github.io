Hello

I am Full Stack Mobile Engineer having 5+ years of experience, currently working at @Freecharge as Lead Android SDE. I love reading stuff on latest updates on android development, system designs and scaled infrastructures.

I love talking about android, architectural practices and kotlin. 

I have a thing for automating things & have experience in setting up backend infrastructure (from setting up multiple domains to autoscaling instances) on aws while developing @FlypTrip.
