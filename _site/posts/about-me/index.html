          <p>Hello</p>

<p>I am Full Stack Mobile Engineer having 5+ years of experience, currently working at @Freecharge as Lead Android SDE. I love reading stuff on latest updates on android development, system designs and scaled infrastructures.</p>

<p>I love talking about android, architectural practices and kotlin.</p>

<p>I have a thing for automating things &amp; have experience in setting up backend infrastructure (from setting up multiple domains to autoscaling instances) on aws while developing @FlypTrip.</p>
